Company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall', ' Further, as a strategic response to changes in the competitive environment, the Company may from time to time make certain pricing, service or marketing decisions that could have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations', \" Factors that may adversely affect the Company's quarterly operating results include (i) the Company's ability to retain existing customers, attract new customers at a steady rate and maintain customer satisfaction, (ii) the Company's ability to manage inventory and fulfillment operations and maintain gross margins, (iii) the announcement or introduction of new sites, services and products by the Company and its competitors, (iv) price competition or higher wholesale prices in the industry, (v) the level of use of the Internet and online services and increasing consumer acceptance of the Internet and other online services for the purchase of consumer products such as those offered by the Company, (vi) the Company's ability to upgrade and develop its systems and infrastructure and attract new personnel in a timely and effective manner, (vii) the level of traffic on the Company's Web site, (viii) technical difficulties, system downtime or Internet brownouts, (ix) the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of the Company's business, operations and infrastructure, (x) the number of popular books introduced during the period, (xi) the level of merchandise returns experienced by the Company, (xii) governmental regulation, and (xiii) general economic conditions and economic conditions specific to the Internet, online commerce and the book industry\", ' Internet usage and the rate of Internet growth may be expected to decline during the summer', \"        Due to the foregoing factors, in one or more future quarters the Company's operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors\", ' (\"CUC\"), and other small entrants, including entrants into narrow specialty niches, that may be aided by partnering with existing distributors, such as Ingram Book Group (\"Ingram\"), that help establish and operate online sites for booksellers, (ii) a number of indirect competitors that specialize in online commerce or derive a substantial portion of their revenues from online commerce, including America Online, Inc', ' (\"AOL\") and Microsoft Corporation, through which other bookstores may offer products, and (iii) publishers, such as Simon & Schuster (operated by Viacom Inc', ' In addition, online retailers may be acquired by, receive investments from or enter into other commercial relationships with larger, well-established and well-financed companies as use of the Internet and other online services increases', \" Certain of the Company's competitors may be able to secure merchandise from vendors on more favorable terms, devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing or inventory availability policies and devote substantially more resources to Web site and systems development than the Company\", ' Increased competition may result in reduced operating margins, loss of market share and a diminished brand franchise', \" There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and competitive pressures faced by the Company may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations\", ' Further, as a strategic response to changes in the competitive environment, the Company may from time to time make certain pricing, service or marketing decisions or acquisitions that could have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations', ' New technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase the competitive pressures on the Company', ' For example, client-agent applications that select specific titles from a variety of Web sites may channel customers to online booksellers that compete with the Company', ' This may make it difficult for management to obtain accurate financial statements and reporting information on a timely basis', \" The Company's inability to add additional software and hardware or to develop and upgrade further its existing technology, transaction-processing systems or network infrastructure to accommodate increased traffic on its Web site or increased sales volume through its transaction-processing systems may cause unanticipated system disruptions, slower response times, degradation in levels of customer service, impaired quality and speed of order fulfillment, and delays in reporting accurate financial information\", ' The Company does not presently have redundant systems or a formal disaster recovery plan and does not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate it for losses that may occur', \" The Company has received, and may continue to receive, a high degree of media coverage, including coverage that is not directly attributable to statements by the Company's officers and employees\", '        In addition, the Internet and other online services may not be accepted as a viable commercial marketplace for a number of reasons, including potentially inadequate development of the necessary network infrastructure or delayed development of enabling technologies and performance improvements', \" If use of the Internet and other online services does not continue to grow or grows more slowly than expected, if the infrastructure for the Internet and other online services does not effectively support growth that may occur, or if the Internet and other online services do not become a viable commercial marketplace, the Company's business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected\", ' The Company may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against such security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches', ' Concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the Internet and other online services and the privacy of users may also inhibit the growth of the Internet and other online services generally, and the Web in particular, especially as a means of conducting commercial transactions', ' The Company may choose to expand its operations by developing new Web sites, promoting new or complementary products or sales formats, expanding the breadth and depth of products and services offered or expanding its market presence through relationships with third parties', ' In addition, the Company may pursue the acquisition of new or complementary businesses, products or technologies, although it has no present understandings, commitments or agreements with respect to any material acquisitions or investments', \" Effective trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which the Company's products and services are made available online\", ' The Company has licensed in the past, and expects that it may license in the future, certain of its proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties', ' However, due to the increasing popularity and use of the Internet and other online services, it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet or other online services covering issues such as user privacy, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution and characteristics and quality of products and services', ' Furthermore, the growth and development of the market for online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on those companies conducting business online', \" The adoption of any additional laws or regulations may decrease the growth of the Internet or other online services, which could, in turn, decrease the demand for the Company's products and services and increase the Company's cost of doing business, or otherwise have an adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations\", ' Moreover, the applicability to the Internet and other online services of existing laws in various jurisdictions governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes, libel and personal privacy is uncertain and may take years to resolve', ' However, one or more states may seek to impose sales tax collection obligations on out-of-state companies such as the Company which engage in online commerce', ' The extent of ownership by the Bezos family may have the effect of preventing a change in control of the Company or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Common Stock', \" These broad market and industry factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of the Common Stock, regardless of the Company's operating performance\", ' may, in its sole discretion and at any time without notice, release all or any portion of the shares subject to such lock-up agreements', ' The rights of the holders of Common Stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any Preferred Stock that may be issued in the future', ' The issuance of Preferred Stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company without further action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of Common Stock', '
